## Briefs for each stage

### üî¥ Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### üü° Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### üü¢ Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### üîµ Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### üü£ Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*This sketch represents an unconventional passing of time through a random flavoured scoop of ice cream being added onto an ice cream cone each second. The title is a play on words because the phrase would mean asking for a second scoop of ice cream on a cone when this is adding a scoop of ice cream to the cone every second. I have imposed a limit so that when the ice cream tower approaches the top of the canvas, it will start over. I wanted to show how more of something can be accumulated through the passing of time until it reaches a limit and then must be rebuilt from the bottom again. The reason for putting this in a repeating cycle is because of how I view time.  Time is an endless loop while everything else is finite; things will rise, then fall and have to rebuild, but time will keep going. You can only have so much of something before its goes or you do, either one, but then the cycle will start again with someone or something new. The random scoop colours represent the unpredictability of circumstances through time because you never know what's going to happen in the next second, minute or year. I have used a dark grey background to allow the ice cream scoops to pop but also not look too harsh as they would against a pure black background.*

  *I wanted to keep with the idea that things can grow over time, fall,  and be re-built. Time is an endless loop but we can choose what we do with it so I added three buttons the user can choose from that add a scoop to the tower. - I also changed the space between the scoops of ice cream so it would take less scoops to reach the top of the canvas. A forth button resets the background and means the user can start stacking the scoops again. I wanted to add a classic ‚Äògame over‚Äô sequence to the sketch, so when the scoops reach the top of the canvas, three blocks of colour move down the screen along with text saying ‚Äústart again‚Äù.
I wanted this sketch to be a bit playful while still having an underlying theme of the passing of time from the previous brief.*

Indeed, as time goes by, things do change. The interaction between two completely different things is particularly appealing. Especially, when a change in one thing often triggers a corresponding change in another, which is often quite interesting. In my project, I included a song, so please turn on the speakers and immerse yourself fully while browsing. As the melody of the song flows, the changes in the song's spectrum on the interface are cleverly represented by the number of ice cream balls stacked in ice cream cones. These ice cream balls, of various flavors and arranged in an orderly manner, visually represent the intensity of different frequencies in the song's spectrum through their numbers. In the process of completing this project, I received assistance from ChatGPT. I asked ChatGPT for advice on how to load music in p5.js and how to process the distributed spectrum obtained from the music. I used the spectrum data at each moment to draw ice cream cones of corresponding heights on the canvas, thus demonstrating that time can be recorded through the changes of tangible objects.

*I started with another student's work that pushed a button and started music with ice cream images dancing to the beat of the music.  I removed the ice cream images. I changed the names of the buttons to ‚ÄòLet's play a game‚Äô.  I removed the ability to pause the music.  

I attempted to make ASCII art by using pixels of an image in text through a video.  I chose this initially because I didn‚Äôt want to make a game directly.  The interactive text-based game was meant to be a player looking at the video and moving around creating different outcomes.  It used an array of letters/numbers/symbols, putting them in order of brightest to darkest or opposite.  However, I failed in my attempt and needed to make a new plan. 

Next, I watched a video on making a sliding puzzle with the help and instruction of The Coding Train on YouTube.  I had issues with the sequence of code.  My preview did not show much action because there were always errors.  This is the tricky part of adding to the code of another person.  The order dramatically affects what will work and what will not.  I needed to be careful with what I removed from the original coding.  But I wanted to keep the entry push button and the music.

I made an image on Raw Pixels and added it to the file to become my source file.  The plan was to create a board array where tiles could move around.  I needed to cut images into pieces and shuffle them randomly to deconstruct and then the interactive game is the player putting the image back together.  I used an index to keep track of the tiles, by splitting up with a number of rows and colums. When the shuffle was set for a low number, it did not mix the puzzle up enough.  I used the mouse pressed for the player to interact with the game.   It was difficult to understand the coding for keeping an empty spot for a piece to be able to move around the board.  The isNeighbor function allows movement beside the empty spot.  This seemed like a simple enough plan; however, there were many errors along the way.   After a very long journey, I was happy with my results.  *

#### Overview:
- I really love the music track that Ruiting added to their piece and that ChristinaLLLL used in the work above. I noticed in Christina's sketch above that if you spammed the play button then the music would trigger multiple times overtop of itself which made a crazy reverberation positive-feedback effect. I thought this was really cool so I wanted to create a random musical living environment that played on this overlaying idea. the sketch is more audiotry than a visual one but I wanted a visual element to help people understand what was going on in the sketch. 5 dots  initially move randomly on their own around the canvas but also are influenced by eachother and the walls of the canvas, bouncing and colliding. Each time the sketch is loaded the dots start in a different location which adds some uniqueness to the outcome of the sound. A snippet of the music track is loaded into the sketch and each time a ball collides it plays the track from the start. The result is a layering effect that sometimes sounds beautiful and sometimes sounds overwhelming. If I could have had more time to experiment I would have attempted to code each ball with a different sound and maybe a different speed however this proved to be way too complicated for now. I also wanted to pay homage to Christina's really beautiful skull collage so I edited it to be more abstract in photoshop (applied a bunch of liquifying filters etc) and added that as the sketch background. I like to think of the sound overlaying as the 'living' aspect of this sketch, it is a musical environment that is different each time and is influenced by slight chaos of the dots moving on their own path and affecting eachother.

#### Attributes:
- coded the dots to move around the canvas at a slowish speed and trialled the size of the canvas as this influenced how many times each track was restarted and overlaid.
- copied the long 3 min song into garageband so that I could trial splitting it up. Originally I wanted to have each ball assigned a different part of the song however this just sounded REALLY BAD. and also there arose some problems with the tracks all abruptly stopping whereas I want the sound to continue as long as the viewer wants to listen. I decided to take a part of the song that was less intense as when you overlay the sounds multiple times the high notes sounded really jarring. by shortening the track that the dots play it means that sometimes the dots could traverse fully across the canvas without repeating their song, so the overall track would sometimes sound less busy as one dot's song ended before it collided with something. I liked this aspect.
- added a start and stop button which are kind of ugly but necessesary to de-bug the sketch - it would go to crazy and sometimes wouldn't start properly if the buttons were not included.

#### Problems/Challenges:
- this one was honestly more tedious with much less of an interesting outcome in comparison to my previous text game sketch. It was just so complicated for some reason. I think if I could keep working on it and perfecting the sound snippets in relation to how often the dots collide and ratio of the canvas I would be able to make a better sounding music environement. There were just so many variables that would change how the overlaying would end up sounding. 
- sometimes the overlaying of all the piano tracks would sound like the devil was crawling out from the depths of hell into my eardrums and I just feel like the viewer would not want that experience too, especially if they listened on headphones.
- I had to tweak the dots quite a few times as the random aspect meant that occasionally they would stick to eachother or get stuck in the canvas wall, this was more prominent when I slowed their speed down as I think they wouldn't have enough velocity to bounce back. ChatGPT helped me with this issue and added some rebound so that the dots would continue to move.
- I attempted to edit the track in a lot of different ways in garageband, I tried saving 5 different versions of snippets of the music piece however sadly this just didn't end up working out how I wanted. I also tried letting the dots play the whole song however it would always start off pretty nice sounding and then slowly become more and more hideous as the high notes kicked in. A multitude of high notes sounds very sickening I found out quickly :D to remedy this, I cut the sound snippet to be just the softer part of the song, so that when they overlay it is less overwhelming.
- because the sounds  were overlapping, I experienced a bit of static noise in the speakers even when playing on low volume - I remidied this by getting some help from chatGPT to reduce the volume on the overall piece to avoid clipping. 
- If I had more time I would continue to tweak this and maybe try and work with tempo - e.g. the dots all move at a speed that works with tempo or half tempos so that they collide on beat. Would be interesting to hear the outcome.
